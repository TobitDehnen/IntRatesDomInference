# IntRatesDomInference

Conventional hierarchy inference methods typically rely on an even distribution of individuals in the data (Goffe et al. 2018) yet some individuals may be consistently involved in more agonistic interactions than others. Current approaches to hierarchy inference may thus result in some individuals appearing to be either more or less dominant in the inferred hierarchy than they actually are.

The code provided here allows the simulating of interactions in animal groups with sex-stratified dominance hierarchies, where males (the dominant sex) either i) interact equally with all females or ii) only with certain (designated as non-breeding) females. Simulation parameters, which can be modified, include: the number of males, number of females, number of breeding females (non-aggressed in biased male aggression scenario), hierarchy steepness and sex-specific dyadic interaction rates.

The consequences of male-female interaction rates for breeding and non-breeding females' inferred hierarchy positions are then illustrated and the simulation output saved.
