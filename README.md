# IntRatesDomInference

Rates of agonistic interactions may vary between dyads in association with individual, or dyadic, attributes such as kinship, pair bond status, age or reproductive status. However, conventional hierarchy inference methods typically rely on an even representation of individuals and interactions between them, in the data. As this is unlikely to be the case in structured social groups, current approaches to hierarchy inference may result in some individuals appearing to be either more or less dominant in the inferred hierarchy than they actually are (i.e., than their dyadic interaction outcomes would reflect). We tested this using two approaches: firstly, randomised Elo ratings, a popular method that builds hierarchies directly from interactions; secondly, Percolation and Conductance approach, a newer method that initially builds dyadic relationships from interaction data, and then uses these dyadic relationships to infer the hierarchy.

The code provided here allows the simulating of outcomes of interactions in animal groups with sex-stratified dominance hierarchies, where males (the dominant sex) either i) tolerate, and thus interact with, all females equally or ii) tolerate only breeding females, whereby males redirect their intersexual interactions towards non-breeding females and concomitantly causing a reduction in the rate of interactions between breeding and non-breeding females (as could occur if breeding, but not-non-breeding, females are tolerated by males at monopolisable resources). Simulation parameters, which can be modified, include: number of times the simulation is run, number of males, number of females, proportion of breeding females (this should correspond to an integer when combined with the number of females), hierarchy steepness, sex-specific dyadic interaction rates, hierarchy inference method, and whether changes in the rank order are compared only within females or across the entire hierarchy (given that females could be over-inferred to be dominant to males).

The consequences of male-female interaction rates for breeding and non-breeding females' inferred hierarchy positions are then illustrated and saved alongside the simulation output.
